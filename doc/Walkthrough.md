# EXILE WALKTHROUGH

by Dokimi  
valid for Exile v0.2.2

Here you can follow me through one game-year of play. 

If you are a struggling beginner this might help you get over the initial “hardcore shock” of Exile.

Success in Exile depends on three things:
- knowledge
- problem solving
- and decision making

Here you will learn some basic knowledge, and you’ll see the kinds of problems and decisions you will face.

As an open ended, open world sandbox game Exile has no “correct” way to play, nor can I cover every possible aspect of the game here. 
This play through follows a cautious technology focused strategy. 
I make some mistakes (some deliberate, others accidental). 
You’ll see how those mistakes can be recovered from... except one.

I die at the end. So it goes.

-----------
# THE START – NOT DYING IMMEDIATELY
## 1. INTERFACE
In the inventory I have access to:
- crafting spots: I will use these to make entry level crafts
- sleeping spot: I can use this to rest anywhere, but it is terrible
- clothing tab: I’ll put on clothes here.
- character tab: this tells me role-playing info (I am a guy called Klo). I can also check “health effects” here e.g. diseases.

I have a sentence of exile (more role-playing: Klo got exiled for abducting
someone), but nothing else.
The HUD tells me:
- how many health effects are currently on (none)
- how thirsty and hungry I am (I’m fine)
- the temperature around me (15°C)
- how much energy I have (e.g. for running around)
- my health (hit points)
- my body temperature (e.g. if I have hypothermia)

These will change color if they are outside safe limits. The temperature is
yellow. I’m a little bit cold. This will drain my energy, that will lead to
increased hunger and thirst. That will limit my ability to move. I could
end up in a viscous spiral. If temperatures drop too low and my energy
drops to zero I risk hypothermia... then death.
## 2: EMERGENCY PRIORITIES
Because I have nothing, this is an emergency.

I must act quick to secure the basics of life.

My first act is to figure out my status and location. I’m on a flat
grassland with some trees. I can see enough resources to live here. I will
stay in this area.

I am starting in spring, so temperatures should get warmer, but the weather
is unpredictable. Right now it is too cold.

Therefore I must find shelter. Nearby is a big hollow tree. It is warmer
under here. This will be my camp.

Next I need tools, a bag, and bedding.

I’m lucky that nearby are some `Gemedi` cane plants - good for fiber. I
collect large amounts and take it back under the tree.



The two greatest tools humanity has invented are the stick and the piece of
string! I’ll need lots of fiber and sticks. For sticks I use the abundant
`Gitiri` shrub and `tree leaves`.
## 3. RESTING AT CAMP
In the shelter of the tree I set up crafting spots. Then I make a sleeping
mat. I put the mat in a warm sheltered location.

When I lie down I can see my energy increasing. I can only rest effectively
in pleasant conditions (e.g. comfortable temperature, out of the rain etc).  
Better quality beds allow me to regain energy quicker.

As I rest I can do some crafting and plan my next move.
## 3. FIRST CRAFTS
It's getting dark, so I make a torch. As night falls I'm a little cold. I
have lots of fiber, so I'll make some clothes. I need a weaving frame. If
it were colder I would need to light a fire too. But this will do.



Because I had so much fibre I also make a bag. This is my first storage
space, and I can carry it with me. Very useful.

I also make a digging stick. A rock chopper can help speed things up too.
## 4. CLOTHES
The clothes make my temperature tolerances temperature range I'm comfortable.

better.
If I’m inside the 
I have heaps of fibre around here, so I'll make all the clothes. But
gathering that fibre in cold torrential rain has left me exhausted.
Thankfully with my clothes, and shelter I am warm enough and can recover.
# EARLY SURVIVAL – MEETING NEEDS
I survived my first day! I didn't immediately die. But now I must look to
the future. I'll need food and water, and I can't live under a tree forever - the seasons will change and this might not be enough.
## 1. FOOD AND WATER
I am a bit thirsty. Suffering from dehydration is bad.
Luckily I already know that `Tangkal` are edible, and have some water content.
Unfortunately its hard to get many, and I fell out and got hurt.

I need a better water source, but this is a barren land. What to do?
It's raining and this ground is wet, so I've dug some puddle holes. These
will fill up with water. I do risk disease drinking out of a mud hole.
## 2. BREAK TAKER
Back to camp to rest the Break taker message has come up. That means I've
been playing for half an hour. This is a reminder because it is easy to
lose track of time. Now is a good time to take a real rest.

You can ignore this message, but after an hour it will become a nag - you
really should at least stand up and stretch after that long!
## 3. WATER POTS I
I'm going to make pots to collect the rain. These are unfired, and useless.

I need a kiln.

I've made a kiln out of dirt. Sealed inside are two pots. The fire will
heat them up, turning them into pottery. It's raining so I put a shelter
over top, to prevent water related mishaps. (note: fires needs to be kept
away from wet soil too, unlike in this shot – this was made during a final
bug testing run!).
## 4. IMPROVING CAMP
While I wait, I've make camp more accessible and tidy. This will save
energy, and potentially my life in an emergency.
## 5. FIRST EXPLORATIONS
I'm doing well. So I explore a bit, gather plants and resources. I always
take a survival bag of essential gear. I don't go far, I’m not ready. I
collect anything that looks interesting.
Back at camp I'm exhausted,
but I've got a safe space that's warm and dry so I'm
okay. If I was still out wandering lost I'd be in
trouble.
## 6. FARMING
I've made a little farm with the plants I found. These might be useful, but
growth takes time.
I used the digging stick to till the soil. Plants need to be in the sun.
Wet loam soils are best. Dry gravel and sand are very bad soils. Tilling
the soil improves it, but risks erosion, and will become depleted. Unless
depleted soils are fertilized (punch with a fertilizer e.g. ash) then they
will degrade.
Extreme weather can inhibit or kill young plants. Animals can eat plants.
## 7. BED SET UP
All this work in cold rain is leaving me exhausted. I improve my resting
spot. I make a better bed so I can recover faster. I have a fire place,
crafting spots, and storage all easily accessible.
## 8. WATER POTS II
My pots are done. I can punch the kiln fire while holding any sediment to
put it out. I put the pots in the rain to collect water.
## 9. EATING MYSTERY PLANTS SAFELY
I’m getting hungry. I have a good supply of `maraka nuts` here... but are
they poisonous? How do I find out?
I have to eat them. If eating this goes horribly wrong I need to be ready
to ride out an illness. I am currently safe at camp. I have food and water.
Time to eat mystery nuts....
I eat one... seems fine... I eat more... seems good... more... oh no! I
have a health condition.
This disease seems fairly harmless. And I'm in good condition to begin
with. Through luck and caution I ride it out easy.
# STONE AGE SKILLS – MOVING FROM SURVIVING TO THRIVING
## 1. SPELUNKING FOR BOULDERS
I want better tools.

For that I'll need a grinding stone. For that I'll need a good hard granite
boulder - I need to go into the caves.
I have a cave nearby, but it's deep so I need ladders. I also need
supplies. If I go unprepared I might never make it out again. I take
torches, ladders, sticks, plus food and water.
Thanks to some luck and some ladders, I was able to get all the boulders I
need.
## 2. NEW CRAFTS
With the boulders and some sand from the nearby beach I make a grinding
stone. Here I can make my new best tool - an adze. I can cut wood.
I’ll make the mortar and pestle, and club too seeing as I can.
I chop some wood and I make a chopping block.

With all these new tools and work stations I can do lots of new things. I
can survive with this level of technology. It’s primitive, but I could go
on perfectly well without advancing further.
# STRATEGIES – MOVING FROM THRIVING TO MASTERY
Technological progression and settled agriculture are strategic choices.
Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. There's a reason humanity
spent >100 000yrs in the stone age. But it is the strategy I will follow
here.
Acquiring iron is a high effort high reward path. That effort might cost me
my life.
## 1. CHARCOAL
Iron smelting needs charcoal, both as a hot burning fuel and as part of the
chemistry of smelting.
It needs huge amounts.
I gather a lot of wood and fiber to make fires. I've dug myself a space in
a gully bank. I fill it up, light the fires, then seal it to block the air.
After some time it will form charcoal.
## 2. EXPLORING FOR ORE, OIL SEEDS, AND NUTS
I’ve decided I need three things. All of them require me to explore.
In Exile "ironstone" is the ore available (in reality there's endless
sources of iron). This is what I’ll smelt into iron.
I also want to make paint. This is excellent for marking trails. As I
explore more, getting lost is a real risk. For paint I need to find lots of
`vansano` to use for its oily seeds.
Lastly the mortar and pestle opens a way to make `maraka` nuts safe to eat –
I will gather nuts as a food source.

I find ore easy, but I don’t yet have the iron tools to mine it.

I need to find boulders I can dig by hand.
After a day exploring I am only able to make paint.
I reconsider my plans.
## 3. FOOD COMES FIRST
Now hunger is a priority - iron can wait. I set out on an expedition for food. I find a promising plant and catch some birds (right click with club).
`Anperla` could become my staple food crop, but growing it in large numbers will take time.

I release the birds near camp, I’ll be able to eat their eggs, although the
males can be an aggressive menace at times.

I now have enough `maraka` to grind it into flour. The toxin that made me ill needs to be removed by soaking.

I expand my areas of farmland with any useful plant I can find.I avoid starvation by collecting fruit. Now all the local fruit trees have
stick ladders for access. But it is hard to build a surplus this way. I've
gathered a lot of stuff now, so make more storage space (pots and bags).
Once my `maraka flour` is detoxed I need to cook it. That needs an oven. I
can also cook some dead animals I found. I don't want to eat those raw.
## 4. ANOTHER USEFUL PLANT
It is now clear I will need to do a lot of exploring to find ore, possibly
down caves too.
I’d like to make glow paint to mark cave trails.
That needs
something bioluminescent.
I find Unfortunately it is rare. I’ll need to farm it.
some `merki` in the nearby mountains.
## 5. PREPPING FOR SMELTING
The weather is now too hot to travel. So I make small improvements to camp.
Otherwise I'm living the stone age good life.
I use the time to prepare for when I do find iron - I start to build a smelter. My charcoal is done too. 
Working in the heat leaves me too thirsty and exhausted to jump, but I built access stairs so I'm fine.
## 6. GETTING WATER IN DROUGHT
The rains are rare now. I build a way to drain soil water and refill my pots. I use the dug material for the smelter.
## 7. THE SMELTER
The smelter is complete. This design can take multiple smelt blocks at
once. Note, unlike the kiln this has drainage space at the bottom. Smelting
is the process of splitting iron from slag. That slag has to go somewhere.
This hole will clog up with slag, and must be kept clear to continue
draining.

(no design is “correct”, experiment with what works given your needs and
resources. If it doesn’t work, modify it.)

But I still have no iron, and the weather has been dangerously hot.
## 8. MORE EXPLORING FOR ORE
I now have a sophisticated little camp.

I decide to explore underground where I'll be out of the heat.
Unfortunately my glow paint is a long way from ready, so I won’t go too
deep. I set up a large batch of charcoal then set off.

I mark my trails, because if I get lost I'm screwed. I'll use glow paint for this in future.

I explore various local cave systems hoping to find accessible iron.

Success! I make sure the cave is clearly marked so I can find it again,
then bring the boulders home.
## 9. SMELTING
Smelting is a complicated process.
First I need to roast the crushed up boulders, then I can grind them up, and mix them with charcoal.
The end mix is what gets smelted. Seeing as the smelter is empty I roast the ore in there.I fire up the smelter.

Some time later it produces its first iron bloom. This is a messy lump of
iron and residual slag. Hammering is required to get rid of those last bits
of slag.

Only a small fraction of the ore rock is iron, and I need enough iron to
make an anvil and tools. I’ll need to find much more ore.
# SEASONS – PLANNING TO SURVIVE THE YEAR
## 1. THINKING AHEAD – BUILDING A HOUSE
Living under a tree has been good enough during summer. But winter will be
sub-zero.

I'm going to build a house.

I have decided to build with bricks and mortar. I have abundant materials and this is good for large complicated buildings. I have other easier options too, but we’ll try this.
I need bricks, and lime mortar.

Bad design and over ambition could come back to haunt me, so I lay out
plans for a small starting room. Bricks are easy to make. They can be fired
like pottery.
Mortar is more complicated. I need to turn crushed lime into quicklime into slaked lime.
Fortunately quicklime is created by heating, so I can fire the bricks
and lime together when I make a new batch of charcoal.

I shove everything into my charcoal hole. It's not the quickest way, but
it's easy.

Quicklime is extremely reactive. Slaked lime is created by putting the
quicklime near freshwater. I use my old soil drainer for that.
## 2. THINKING AHEAD – WINTER SUPPLIES
The effort of smelting and brick making has taken me into late summer,
early autumn. I am building up supplies of food, and of firewood for
heating.
This is my first year farming, so the harvest is small and dominated by low
value crops. The local trees are low on fruit and nuts too.
Getting food in winter will be hard. 
Time for a foraging expedition.
## 3. TRAVELLING LONG DISTANCE – A FORAGING EXPEDITION
I will be staying away from my camp for the first time. I need to take
supplies so that I have no trouble surviving for however many days I'm
gone.

I have food, water, tools, fire, and a bed. The thatch can be used to make a shelter. I have a second bag for what I gather. I'm well rested and fed. I'll mark my trails with paint, and follow the coast as a landmark. The weather could be better, but I'll have to make do.

Unwisely, I pushed myself too hard by walking for two days non-stop in
pouring rain. I'm at my limits. I can barely move. When I sought shelter
under trees I was attacked by spiders - I'm too weak to fight. My
exhaustion is making me thirsty and hungry. I even picked up a fungal
infection. I'm in serious danger... but I'm prepared. I put up my shelter
and use my supplies. I had to use up a lot of my rations, but I survive.Following the coast brings me in a circle back to camp - it's a lake. I
have a reasonable little haul of nuts and other things. However, forage
around here is scarce. I won't find much there again.
## 4. DISASTER – OR, A LESSON IN APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY CHOICE
Brick firing failed. I didn't use enough firewood, it never got hot enough.
Winter is coming and my building plans are in chaos. I try firing bricks any way I can, but this isn’t going to be fast enough or produce enough in time.
I chose the most sophisticated option for building my house, so it's no
surprise I've had problems. I wasn't ready for that level of
sophistication - just because you can doesn't mean you should. Indeed, I
could've made the whole thing out of mud if I was desperate.
I build the roof while I wait for attempt two at brick making.
## 5. SURVIVING DISEASE
Living in the damp mud is catching up with me. I have a severe fungal
infection. I've had the misfortune to get a bad case of food poisoning too.
Time to move my bed under the new roof.
I'm laid low and can't replenish my fluids as but I do have hakimi – take the edge off, and work. Luckily my stored supplies mean I can I spew my guts out. I don’t have herbal medicine, one of the plants that goes into it. This can help can cure some mild infections.
## 6. PREPARING FOR FAILURE – BACK UP OPTIONS
The nights are getting cold and my house is barely begun.
Time to work on an emergency backup. In the nearby deep cave I put a bed. I
make everything easy to access so I can get down here in a hurry. I keep a
lamp stored here for light, and oil to refuel it. I even plant some
mushrooms. This is a safe place, but it's a hassle coming down here. I
don't want to live here, but I can if I need to.
## 7. BUILDING WITH WHAT YOU’VE GOT
I fired more bricks, but I’ve made a pathetically small number.
Fortunately I saved the clay from clearing the site, and used it to make
rammed earth. The bricks make a nice foundation (they’ll stop the walls
from collapsing if I dig under them). Because I built the roof first even
this half done structure has some value.
# WINTER – OH CRAP THAT’S COLD
## 1. LAST MINUTE PRIORITIES
Cold weather is setting in.
I’ve finally produced enough iron to make an anvil, but no tools. And the
house is unfinished. I can live without tools – I finish the house first.
I have a decent little farmstead prepped for the winter.
## 2. LAST MINUTE EXPEDITIONS (AND GETTING LOST)
This late autumn/early winter weather is erratic.
Currently the weather is okay.
I'm so close to having enough iron it's worth risking another short trip.
Success!
I now have a problem - I'm lost. I'd hope to circle back to camp. Didn't
work.
But I’ve been marking trails. I know I've been here before thanks to marker
paint. I must be close to home. It feels frustrating, but I'll have to back
track.
I change the paint to a new symbol so I can distinguish the trail I made,
from the one I'm making now - otherwise I might go in circles. I follow my
old paint trail, then recognize a landmark. I was never far from home. If
I'd panicked things could have gone horribly wrong. The weather is turning
bad. A snowstorm has set in.
## 3. WEATHER PROOFING
Working outside is now dangerous. I can build shelter at key places to make
things safer.
Travel is now unwise. Instead I can make improvements around camp, and
prepare to for future expeditions.
On a side note: be careful with fire.
## 4. PREPARING FOR WHAT YOU WILL HAVE
I still don’t have much iron, but I can gather things I will need when I
do.
When I get enough iron I will be able to access new crafts. Most important
is better weaving technology. So far I have used any old thing for fiber.
In future I will need something high quality - cana. And lots of it. I
might as well gather and farm it now. Cane type plants need wet soil. I can
use the wet gullies to grow them.
## 5. DRUGS
I'm fermenting some fruit into an energy drink - Tang.
This mildly alcoholic drink has water, energy, and food value. It’s better than carrying jugs of water - I just need to be careful not to get drunk and fall out of a tree. I also make some stimulants - Tiku. This is an unpredictable drug, but the boost it provides might get me out of a tight spot one day.
## 6. KEEPING CLOSE TO HOME
In the freezing conditions even short trips are exhausting. I'll be
limiting time outside until I can make winter clothes. A lot of time is
spent at home by the fire.
I spend time improving the farmstead, adding extensions to the house for
workshops and storage.
I have a pick axe now, so I’m mining ore from the closest location, which
happens to be an unusual place...
## 7. WHAT LIES IN THE DEEP?
I found iron down a strange shaft so I've already been building ladders down. I am able to get right down to the bottom. I'm in a corridor. What is this place?
That is a mystery... but I'll soon find it is a place of high risks and
high rewards. To get the good stuff I want to go deep, and I want to get
out alive.
(note: this part of the game is partly incomplete. It's still worth
checking out though)
I need to mark my access clearly. If I lose this, I might never get out
again. This place is a maze. Short trips. Well marked. Because getting lost
is such an issue here, I’m going to try to go down these big shafts.
I’ll need something longer. It's very tempting to start wandering down the
corridors, but I resist. I return to camp. I'll come back when I'm ready.
## A STRATEGY PAYS OFF – IRON’S REWARDS
Thanks to my pick axe and mining I’m rapidly expanding my access to iron. I
begin to reap the benefits.
I finally have smelted enough for a tools and a carpentry bench. The
weather is starting to turn towards spring. Food supplies have held up.
Things are looking good.
## 1. QUALITY WEAVING
Now I can build a spinning wheel and start to process the cana I gathered.
"Retting" is a process in manufacturing fiber from plant stems were the
plant is soaked in water long enough for unwanted materials to decompose,
leaving behind the tough fiber. That means these bundles need to be soaked
underwater. My new workshop includes a soaking pit, so I put them in there.
Soon I make a loom. Because it is heading towards spring I will make light
clothes instead of heavy. Then I aim for a bed, a bag, and a rope. These
high quality woven fabrics take a lot of fiber – but I have been gathering
and growing plenty.
## 2. A LIFE OF SECURITY AND ABUNDANCE
I have new clothes a better bed, bag and rope. New workshops are almost
done. With a sophisticated place like this the next year will be much
easier than the first. I will be much freer to explore, build, and
experiment.

The dangers now will come not from need, but from chosen risk taking....
# DOING SOMETHING STUPID – A GLORIOUS DEATH
Let’s go back underground.

I’m climbing down the giant shafts. Whenever I can't directly build a stick
ladder down, I use my rope to climb down a level, then use sticks to climb
back up and get the rope. Repeat. The risk of falling is high, and it is
slow. But if successful I will have a secure path deep into the city from
which I can safely explore. Hopefully I will only need to use it once...
I'm hoping to build a transporter.

This complicated, slightly dangerous device will teleport me from surface to deep.

A pad with the needed components next to it can be linked via a key to a second pad.

The power cells can be recharged by heating.
Building two of these (one in the deep, one at my farmstead) is my goal...
I will never achieve it.

I've fallen.

I'm lucky to be alive. But I can't get back up that way.

This is the curse of the City. I might never make it out of this place alive.

On the upside, I've reached a decent depth. I'm more likely to find the
treasures which will help me get out.
Thanks to cave mushrooms I now have glow paint. This makes it much easier
to find my way. Seeing as I'm stuck anyway, I'm going to explore, hoping to
find something good. I mark my trails with glow paint.
I find my first artifacts. They are not much use, but it's a hint that
strange things are to be found here. I slowly accumulate more items,
growing ever more greedy...
until one wrong step...
One year after being exiled, Klo plunges to his death in a mysterious
temple, his bags laden with golden treasures. All he has built is left to
others.
# CONCLUSION
If you’ve made it this far, you’ll see that most success comes down to decision making. Death and disaster is often the result of having done something stupid.
Indeed, that’s the point of Exile – to put your skills to the test in an arena where failure doesn’t matter.
Remember, this was only one way of playing the game (also remember it’s in alpha!). A play through following a different strategy in a different location will look different!
I hope that helps you overcome some of the beginner’s terror from the harsh yet abundant world of Exile. Enjoy.
