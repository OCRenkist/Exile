## Error correction

# If your map has broken half-bed objects that can't be interacted with. 
# 
# Enabling this LBM will remove them at the cost of a bit of performance.
# If you know how it happened, please let me know so I can prevent it.

## Settings for displays

# Select the temperature scale to display in the HUD.

# For singleplayer or LAN, this can be left at 0.1, but on Internet

## Settings for respawning

## Update shape ABM

# Define which method is used when generating a new area.
#  - VoxelManip (default) is the most efficient one, but the area will be available only once it is completely updated and may be resource intensive. This is the preferred method as map generation is optimized not to impact the game.
#  - Progressive is way much slower, but the area is available directly in it's untransformed shape. The nodes will be updated one after the other while the game is rather idle. This method is preferred on old single core CPU that cannot benefit from map generation optimization, if the areas are too long to emerge or if you like to see mountains smoothing themselves progressively.

## Update shape on dig and place

# Enable or disable shape update of neighbor nodes when one is placed or updated.

## Rendering

# Enable smooth rendering instead of cubic.
